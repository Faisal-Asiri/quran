(21, 2, 14, 'And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We believe\"; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, \"Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.\"'),
(22, 2, 15, '[But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly.'),
(23, 2, 16, 'Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.'),
(24, 2, 17, 'Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see.'),
(25, 2, 18, 'Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].'),
(26, 2, 19, 'Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers.'),
(27, 2, 20, 'The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.'),
(28, 2, 21, 'O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous -'),
(29, 2, 22, '[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].'),
(30, 2, 23, 'And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.'),
(31, 2, 24, 'But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.'),
(32, 2, 25, 'And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, \"This is what we were provided with before.\" And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.'),
(33, 2, 26, 'Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, \"What did Allah intend by this as an example?\" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient,'),
(34, 2, 27, 'Who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers.'),
(35, 2, 28, 'How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned.'),
(36, 2, 29, 'It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things.'),
(37, 2, 30, 'And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, \"Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.\" They said, \"Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?\" Allah said, \"Indeed, I know that which you do not know.\"'),
(38, 2, 31, 'And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, \"Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.\"'),

(41, 2, 34, 'And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate before Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.'),
(42, 2, 35, 'And We said, \"O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.\"'),
(43, 2, 36, 'But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, \"Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time.\"'),
(44, 2, 37, 'Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.'),
(45, 2, 38, 'We said, \"Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.'),

(48, 2, 41, 'And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.'),
(49, 2, 42, 'And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].'),
(50, 2, 43, 'And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience].'),
(51, 2, 44, 'Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?'),
(52, 2, 45, 'And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah]'),
(53, 2, 46, 'Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him.'),
(54, 2, 47, 'O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.'),
(55, 2, 48, 'And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be aided.'),
(56, 2, 49, 'And [recall] when We saved your forefathers from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.'),
(57, 2, 50, 'And [recall] when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.'),
(58, 2, 51, 'And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights. Then you took [for worship] the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers.'),
(59, 2, 52, 'Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.'),
(60, 2, 53, 'And [recall] when We gave Moses the Scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided.'),
(61, 2, 54, 'And [recall] when Moses said to his people, \"O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves. That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator.\" Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.'),
(62, 2, 55, 'And [recall] when you said, \"O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright\"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.'),
(63, 2, 56, 'Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful.'),
(64, 2, 57, 'And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you.\" And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves.'),
(65, 2, 58, 'And [recall] when We said, \"Enter this city and eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly and say, \'Relieve us of our burdens.\' We will [then] forgive your sins for you, and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward].\"'),
(66, 2, 59, 'But those who wronged changed [those words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down upon those who wronged a punishment from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying.'),
(67, 2, 60, 'And [recall] when Moses prayed for water for his people, so We said, \"Strike with your staff the stone.\" And there gushed forth from it twelve springs, and every people knew its watering place. \"Eat and drink from the provision of Allah, and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.\"'),
(68, 2, 61, 'And [recall] when you said, \"O Moses, we can never endure one [kind of] food. So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from the earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions.\" [Moses] said, \"Would you exchange what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked.\" And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from Allah [upon them]. That was because they [repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.'),
(69, 2, 62, 'Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.'),
(70, 2, 63, 'And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel, to abide by the Torah] and We raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous.\"'),
(71, 2, 64, 'Then you turned away after that. And if not for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have been among the losers.'),
(72, 2, 65, 'And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath, and We said to them, \"Be apes, despised.\"'),
(73, 2, 66, 'And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded [them] and a lesson for those who fear Allah.'),
(74, 2, 67, 'And [recall] when Moses said to his people, \"Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow.\" They said, \"Do you take us in ridicule?\" He said, \"I seek refuge in Allah from being among the ignorant.\"'),
(75, 2, 68, 'They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is.\" [Moses] said, \"[Allah] says, \'It is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,\' so do what you are commanded.\"'),
(76, 2, 69, 'They said, \"Call upon your Lord to show us what is her color.\" He said, \"He says, \'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.\' \"'),
(77, 2, 70, 'They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us. And indeed we, if Allah wills, will be guided.\"'),
(78, 2, 71, 'He said, \"He says, \'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.\' \" They said, \"Now you have come with the truth.\" So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it.'),
(79, 2, 72, 'And [recall] when you slew a man and disputed over it, but Allah was to bring out that which you were concealing.'),
(80, 2, 73, 'So, We said, \"Strike the slain man with part of it.\" Thus does Allah bring the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you might reason.'),
(81, 2, 74, 'Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder. For indeed, there are stones from which rivers burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and water comes out, and there are some of them that fall down for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.'),
(82, 2, 75, 'Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then distort the Torah after they had understood it while they were knowing?'),
(83, 2, 76, 'And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We have believed\"; but when they are alone with one another, they say, \"Do you talk to them about what Allah has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your Lord?\" Then will you not reason?'),
(84, 2, 77, 'But do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare?'),
(85, 2, 78, 'And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except in wishful thinking, but they are only assuming.'),
(86, 2, 79, 'So woe to those who write the \"scripture\" with their own hands, then say, \"This is from Allah,\" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.'),
(87, 2, 80, 'And they say, \"Never will the Fire touch us, except for a few days.\" Say, \"Have you taken a covenant with Allah? For Allah will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know?\"'),
(88, 2, 81, 'Yes, whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.'),
(89, 2, 82, 'But they who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.'),
(90, 2, 83, 'And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], \"Do not worship except Allah; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah.\" Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.'),
(91, 2, 84, 'And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], \"Do not shed each other\'s blood or evict one another from your homes.\" Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing.'),
(92, 2, 85, 'Then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.'),
(93, 2, 86, 'Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world [in exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided.'),
(94, 2, 87, 'And We did certainly give Moses the Torah and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.'),
(95, 2, 88, 'And they said, \"Our hearts are wrapped.\" But, [in fact], Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe.'),
(96, 2, 89, 'And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allah will be upon the disbelievers.'),
(97, 2, 90, 'How wretched is that for which they sold themselves - that they would disbelieve in what Allah has revealed through [their] outrage that Allah would send down His favor upon whom He wills from among His servants. So they returned having [earned] wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment.'),
(98, 2, 91, 'And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what Allah has revealed,\" they say, \"We believe [only] in what was revealed to us.\" And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, \"Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you are [indeed] believers?\"'),
(99, 2, 92, 'And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.'),
(100, 2, 93, 'And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and listen.\" They said [instead], \"We hear and disobey.\" And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, \"How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers.\"'),
(101, 2, 94, 'Say, [O Muhammad], \"If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.'),
(102, 2, 95, 'But they will never wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers.'),
(103, 2, 96, 'And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with Allah. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years, but it would not remove him in the least from the [coming] punishment that he should be granted life. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.'),
(104, 2, 97, 'Say, \"Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - it is [none but] he who has brought the Qur\'an down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.\"'),
(105, 2, 98, 'Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.'),
(106, 2, 99, 'And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.'),
(107, 2, 100, 'Is it not [true] that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away? But, [in fact], most of them do not believe.'),
(108, 2, 101, 'And when a messenger from Allah came to them confirming that which was with them, a party of those who had been given the Scripture threw the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained].'),
(109, 2, 102, 'And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, \"We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].\" And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah. And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.'),
(110, 2, 103, 'And if they had believed and feared Allah, then the reward from Allah would have been [far] better, if they only knew.'),
(111, 2, 104, 'O you who have believed, say not [to Allah \'s Messenger], \"Ra\'ina\" but say, \"Unthurna\" and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.'),
(112, 2, 105, 'Neither those who disbelieve from the People of the Scripture nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But Allah selects for His mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty.'),
(113, 2, 106, 'We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?'),
(114, 2, 107, 'Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides Allah any protector or any helper?'),
(115, 2, 108, 'Or do you intend to ask your Messenger as Moses was asked before? And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.'),
(116, 2, 109, 'Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.'),
(117, 2, 110, 'And establish prayer and give zakah, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. Indeed, Allah of what you do, is Seeing.'),
(118, 2, 111, 'And they say, \"None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.\" That is [merely] their wishful thinking, Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"'),
(119, 2, 112, 'Yes [on the contrary], whoever submits his face in Islam to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.'),
(120, 2, 113, 'The Jews say \"The Christians have nothing [true] to stand on,\" and the Christians say, \"The Jews have nothing to stand on,\" although they [both] recite the Scripture. Thus the polytheists speak the same as their words. But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.'),
(121, 2, 114, 'And who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of Allah from being mentioned in His mosques and strive toward their destruction. It is not for them to enter them except in fear. For them in this world is disgrace, and they will have in the Hereafter a great punishment.'),
(122, 2, 115, 'And to Allah belongs the east and the west. So wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face of Allah. Indeed, Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.'),
(123, 2, 116, 'They say, \"Allah has taken a son.\" Exalted is He! Rather, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are devoutly obedient to Him,'),
(124, 2, 117, 'Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, \"Be,\" and it is.'),
(125, 2, 118, 'Those who do not know say, \"Why does Allah not speak to us or there come to us a sign?\" Thus spoke those before them like their words. Their hearts resemble each other. We have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain [in faith].'),
(126, 2, 119, 'Indeed, We have sent you, [O Muhammad], with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and you will not be asked about the companions of Hellfire.'),
(127, 2, 120, 'And never will the Jews or the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion. Say, \"Indeed, the guidance of Allah is the [only] guidance.\" If you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would have against Allah no protector or helper.'),
(128, 2, 121, 'Those to whom We have given the Book recite it with its true recital. They [are the ones who] believe in it. And whoever disbelieves in it - it is they who are the losers.'),
(129, 2, 122, 'O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.'),
(130, 2, 123, 'And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, and no compensation will be accepted from it, nor will any intercession benefit it, nor will they be aided.'),
(131, 2, 124, 'And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham was tried by his Lord with commands and he fulfilled them. [Allah] said, \"Indeed, I will make you a leader for the people.\" [Abraham] said, \"And of my descendants?\" [Allah] said, \"My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.\"'),
(132, 2, 125, 'And [mention] when We made the House a place of return for the people and [a place of] security. And take, [O believers], from the standing place of Abraham a place of prayer. And We charged Abraham and Ishmael, [saying], \"Purify My House for those who perform Tawaf and those who are staying [there] for worship and those who bow and prostrate [in prayer].\"'),

Look at your food and your drink; it has not changed with time. And look at your donkey; and We will make you a sign for the people.

That is more just in the sight of Allah and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves. For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any witness.
